# Work Expectations
Your work must unambiguously demonstrate mastery of the problem. It should be clearly and evidently your own. 

### Question 1
For parts (a) through (e), set up and solve a summation to find a closed form for $T(n)$. For parts (f) through (i), argue that your solution is correct. For all parts, it is helpful to check your solution by plugging in several values for $n$ into both the formula and the code. The number of executions of `// op` should agree.

### Question 2

### Question 3

### Question 4

### Question 5

# Submission Expectations
Work can either be completed on a printed version of the PDF or in a PDF editor. 

If a printed version of the PDF is used, the submission can include pictures of or scanned versions of the pages, but they must be properly sized and aligned. 5 misaligned submissions require as much grading effort as the other 90 submissions. Do not expect credit for misaligned submissions. 

If a PDF editor is used, the document must still remain properly sized and aligned. Work must be clear and complete. If you need to use mathematical symbols and cannot type/draw them, consider printing the document instead. There is no difference in rigor expectations between handwritten and PDF edited submissions. Again, do not expect credit for misaligned submissions.
