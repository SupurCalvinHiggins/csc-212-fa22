# Work Expectations
Your work must unambiguously demonstrate mastery of the problem. It should be clearly and evidently your own. Instructor(s) and TAs should be unable to even question if your answers were copied. That is, your work should be beyond suspicion. It should be clear, correct and otherwise unimpeachable.
### Question 1
Code must be clearly traced.
### Question 2
Code must be clearly traced.
### Question 3
Code must be clearly traced OR the properties must be proved/disproved.
### Question 4
The recurrence relation must be solved through substitution OR iteration OR a recursion tree OR solved directly. A proof is NOT required.
### Question 5
The recurrence relation must be solved through substitution OR iteration OR a recursion tree OR solved directly. A proof is NOT required.
### Question 6
Must discuss the performance of vector-based queues. If the answer is yes, an argument/proof must be provided that no better implementation exists. If the answer is no, a counterexample must be provided.
### Question 7
None.
### Question 8
None.
### Question 8
None.
### Question 9
None.
### Question 10
None.
### Question 11
Code must be clearly traced.
### Question 12
Must include drawings of trees. If the answer is yes, an argument/proof must be provided. If the answer is no, a counterexample must be provided (drawings count).
### Question 13
Must include drawings of trees. If the answer is yes, an argument/proof must be provided. If the answer is no, a counterexample must be provided (drawings count).
### Question 14
Must include a drawing of the binary search tree after the insertions OR an argument/proof must be provided with appeals to algorithm and data structure invariants. 
### Question 15
Must include a drawing of the binary search tree after the insertions OR an argument/proof must be provided with appeals to algorithm and data structure invariants. 
### Question 16
Must include drawings of trees OR refer to drawings of trees provided elsewhere OR an argument/proof must be provided. 
### Question 17
Must include drawings of trees OR refer to drawings of trees provided elsewhere OR an argument/proof must be provided. 
### Question 18
Must include drawings of trees OR refer to drawings of trees provided elsewhere OR an argument/proof must be provided.
