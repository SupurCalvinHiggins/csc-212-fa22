# Work Expectations
Your work must unambiguously demonstrate mastery of the problem. It should be clearly and evidently your own. Instructor(s) and TAs should be unable to even question if your answers were copied. That is, your work should be beyond suspicion. It should be clear, correct and otherwise unimpeachable.
### Question 1
Code must be clearly traced OR an argument/proof with appeals to algorithm and data structure invariants must be provided.
### Question 2
Code must be clearly traced OR an argument/proof with appeals to algorithm and data structure invariants must be provided.
### Question 3
Code must be clearly traced OR the properties must be proved/disproved.
### Question 4
The recurrence relation must be solved through substitution OR iteration OR a recursion tree OR solved directly. An inductive proof is NOT required (but is FANTASTIC to see).
### Question 5
The recurrence relation must be solved through substitution OR iteration OR a recursion tree OR solved directly. An inductive proof is NOT required (but is FANTASTIC to see).
### Question 6
The performance of vector-based queues must be discussed. If the answer is yes, an argument/proof must be provided that no better implementation exists. If the answer is no, a counterexample must be provided (a data structure that can implement queue operations more efficiently).
### Question 7
None.
### Question 8
None.
### Question 8
None.
### Question 9
None.
### Question 10
None.
### Question 11
Code must be clearly traced.
### Question 12
Must include drawings of trees. If the answer is yes, an argument/proof must be provided. If the answer is no, a counterexample must be provided (drawings count).
### Question 13
Must include drawings of trees. If the answer is yes, an argument/proof must be provided. If the answer is no, a counterexample must be provided (drawings count).
### Question 14
Must include a drawing of the binary search tree after the insertions OR an argument/proof must be provided with appeals to algorithm and data structure invariants. 
### Question 15
Must include a drawing of the binary search tree after the insertions OR an argument/proof must be provided with appeals to algorithm and data structure invariants. 
### Question 16
Must include drawings of trees OR refer to drawings of trees provided elsewhere OR an argument/proof must be provided. 
### Question 17
Must include drawings of trees OR refer to drawings of trees provided elsewhere OR an argument/proof must be provided. 
### Question 18
Must include drawings of trees OR refer to drawings of trees provided elsewhere OR an argument/proof must be provided. 
### Question 19
Must include drawings of trees OR refer to drawings of trees provided elsewhere OR an argument/proof must be provided.
