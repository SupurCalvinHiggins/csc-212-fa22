## CSC 212: Data Structures & Algorithms

### Fall 2022

***

### <u>Premise</u>

Build an algorithm to interpret course grades into a semester final grade.

### <u>Purpose:</u>

Knowing your grade throughout the term is one of the most critical tools you have at your disposal as a student. Without this knowledge, it becomes incredibly difficult to assess your knowledge of the subject matter relative to a course. It also means not knowing where you stand in a course and more importantly whether you may truly need help or not.

This project, when successfully compiled, will aleviate that concern for this course. An effective output will provide merely a course grade calculated based on all possible points that can be earned within the course. 

*Note: I'm not looking for fancy, I'm looking for effective, clean code.*

### <u>Requirements</u>

- Choose a group of 3-4 members to complete the following:

#### <u>Part 1</u>

- Algorithm successfully compiles providing accurate output with direct regard to input with specific attention to catagorical & item weights for _*THIS*_ course
- Documentation  
  - `readme.md`, includes:
    - group memebr names
    - a brief summary of the project and github repo address (with allowed access for viewing) for member contributions _(most easily shown through commits in the repo where your project lives)_
    - proof of planning: pseudocode (and or flowcharts showing program logic if desired)
    - describe features of the algorithm
      - 'what input can it take in'
      - 'what is/are the output(s) you can receive back?'
      - 'why was development like this important to your group?'
    - clear, conscientious comments embedded within the your code
    - provide detailed instructions how to compile your algorithm, including:
      - how to input data
      - how to compile each/any option from your feature set
  - Recorded Walkthrough
    - provide a 5 - 10 minute code analysis video
      - describe the different aspects of your code: how it works and how your group concluded on your implememntations
      - compile your code demonstrating a working prototype using all posssible function/method calls and outputs
- Datasets
  - Include a mock dataset for each group memeber
  - *Note: hardcoding datasets is allowed as the use of databases is not required/desired for this project.*
- Use only what you know from CSC 211
- Required Structures
  - At least one `Class` structure
  - Use `vectors` over `arrays`

#### <u>Part 2</u>

- Research and respond:
  - Reevaluate your algorithm and consider if this were to be scaled up to production level, and incorporated into a software like Gradescope: what might you apply from CSC 212 to make the most efficent program it can be for that use case?
  - This will be a single page summary of your theoretical application of CSC 212 to a production level gradebook algorithm

### <u>Grading</u>

Each part will be graded on a pass/fail basis and evaluated against the requirements above. Successful submission and completion of tasks will earn...

| | Added To Overall Course Grade |
| :--: | :--: |
| Part 1 | +2.5 |
| Part 2 | +1.5 |

Your performance on the project can bear no negative effect on your course grade. Only give a boost where for some, it may be necessary.

### <u>Tips for Success</u>

- Start early!!
- Think about what would be helpful to know, as a student, about your grade for the semester; some suggestions:
  - term grade
  - midterm grade
  - overall catagorical total
  - individual catagorical grades
- This project is for you! Treat it as such and be realistic about your design and implementation. Just make sure to cover all the requirements!
